# Some Tips to Work With

* Write like a journalist by putting the important information up front with links to further details
* Write concisely and in plain english
* Start from scratch and use only what you need
* Review, review, review
* Only underline hyperlinks and use **bold** or *italics* sparingly instead for emphasis

# Help Readers Scan

> *from [Usability.gov](http://www.usability.gov/methods/design_site/writing4web.html)*

* Use headings and sub-headings
* Write short sentences
* Limit paragraphs to two-three sentences
* Use bulleted or numbered lists
* Plan to use pictures, images, diagrams, or illustrations to visually represent ideas in the content
* Add a table of contents at the top of the page and hyperlink the categories to the related content on the page
* Use white space to visually separate information

# Structure Your Text

Make use of **bold headings**, short paragraphs, bullet lists and tables if the information requires it. 

To better organize your thoughts, divide your article into sub-headings. Sub-headings make things easier to digest. 

Instead of tackling the entire article at once, try writing one paragraph at a time.



# Test Your Content's Readability

After you have been writing your content in notepad. You may paste it into Microsoft Word and use the Readability Statistics feature.

This is not required, but may be used to help you analyze your content.

# Review, Review, Review, Refresh

Review your content before you publish.

Get someone else to read your content and check if it "makes sense" to them.

Make yourself a reminder to go through your site and make sure the content is current.
