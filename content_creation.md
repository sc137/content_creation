# Try These...

* Write like a journalist by putting the important information up front with links to further details
* Write concisely and in plain english
* Start from scratch and use only what you need
* Review, review, review
* Only underline hyperlinks and use **bold** or *italics* sparingly instead for emphasis

# Help Readers Scan

>> *from [Usability.gov](http://www.usability.gov/methods/design_site/writing4web.html)*

* Use headings and sub-headings
* Write short sentences
* Limit paragraphs to two-three sentences
* Use bulleted or numbered lists
* Plan to use pictures, images, diagrams, or illustrations to visually represent ideas in the content
* Add a table of contents at the top of the page and hyperlink the categories to the related content on the page
* Use white space to visually separate information

# Structure Your Text

- Make use of **bold headings**, short paragraphs, bullet lists and tables if the information requires it. 


- To better organize your thoughts, divide your article into sub-headings. Sub-headings make things easier to digest. 


- Instead of tackling the entire article at once, try writing one paragraph at a time.



# Test Your Content's Readability

Try pasting your content into Microsoft Word and use the Readability Statistics feature.

# What's the Score?

The [Flesch Reading Ease](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flesch-Kincaid_Readability_Test) score can be used to identify the age at which an audience will be able to understand your writing.

    Score 		Notes
    90.0–100.0 	easily understood by an average 11-year-old student
    60.0–70.0 	easily understood by 13- to 15-year-old students
    0.0–30.0 	best understood by university graduates

How do they calculate this?
